# Best Practices

- Prefer `search_code` to build context before asking for refactors

- Use `write_file` preview mode to review changes before applying

- Keep commands hermetic: tests, linters, formatters only

- Add project-aware prompts: e.g., `code_review` guidance for your stack

- Pin Python version in `.python-version` or `.tool-versions`

- Back up audit log and review periodically
